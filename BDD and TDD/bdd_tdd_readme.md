# Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) vs. Test-Driven Development (TDD)

## Overview

Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) is a software development methodology that focuses on defining system behavior from an external perspective. Unlike Test-Driven Development (TDD), which emphasizes individual component correctness, BDD ensures that all components work together to meet business goals.

## Key Differences Between BDD and TDD

| Feature  | BDD                                            | TDD                                           |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Approach | Outside-in (system behavior)                   | Inside-out (component correctness)            |
| Goal     | Ensuring the system does the right thing       | Ensuring individual components work correctly |
| Audience | Developers, testers, domain experts, customers | Developers                                    |
| Language | Gherkin (natural language)                     | Unit test assertions                          |

## Testing

### Smoke Testing
Smoke testing is a basic level of software testing that checks whether the most crucial functions of an application work properly. It helps identify major issues before deeper testing.

### Unit Testing
**Unit testing** is a software testing procedure that examines individual software units. A unit refers to a section of an applicationâ€”a function, method, procedure, or entire module.

### Regression Testing
The goal of testing is to ensure that code changes haven't introduced bugs to the software.

### Performance Testing
Performance tests determine:
- Whether the application responds quickly
- The maximum user load the software application can handle
- If the application is stable under varying loads

### Vulnerability Testing
Vulnerability testing is used to reduce the chances of intruders or hackers gaining unauthorized access to systems.

### End-to-End Testing
The purpose is to test the entire software product for dependencies, data integrity, and connectivity with other systems, interfaces, and databases.

### User Interface (UI) Testing
The goal of UI testing is to ensure all UI elements meet performance and functionality requirements and are free from defects.
