![CICD](/Media/ci-cd.png)


## What is CI/CD?
The CI/CD method helps solve any problems that the integration of new code may bring to development and operations teams. It offers continuous automation and monitoring throughout the lifecycle of an applicationâ€”from integration and testing to delivery and deployment.



## What is Continuous Integration?**
Continuous Integration (CI) is a core development practice where developers merge their code changes into a central repository multiple times a day. Each merge triggers an automated pipeline that builds and tests the application. The primary goal is to provide rapid feedback, catching integration bugs early and ensuring the codebase is always in a healthy, working state.

### Basic Principles of CI
- Maintain a managed repository of code
- Integrate changes as frequently as possible (ideally daily)
- Build every commit
- Implement self-tested builds to identify errors early
- Store and maintain a history of builds (archive)
- Use multiple environments sorted by code stability
- Ensure that the master branch is always deployable
- Use automated tools to monitor the version control system and trigger builds
- Perform automated tests on every pull request before merging
- Encourage code reviews via pull requests to improve code quality
- Assume that untested code does not work and should not be merged into the master branch
- Reduce merge conflicts by working in short-lived feature branches
- Delete branches after merging to keep the repository clean

### When Does the CI Process End?
The Continuous Integration (CI) process concludes when a clean, successful build produces a versioned, tested, and packaged **artifact**. At this point, the team has a high degree of confidence that the new code integrates correctly with the existing codebase and is ready for the next stage.

This final artifact is the handover point from CI to the Continuous Delivery (CD) process. The end of CI is the beginning of deployment readiness.

### How often do you need to run a Continuous Integration pipeline?
- Every commit
- At least once per feature build

## CI/CD Pipeline
A CI/CD pipeline is a series of steps from code commit to deployment, automating build, test, and release processes.

### Core Steps of a CI Pipeline
When building a CI pipeline from scratch, you would typically include the following fundamental steps, designed to provide feedback as quickly as possible ("fail fast"):

1.  **Commit & Trigger:** Developers commit code to a shared version control repository (like Git). This action automatically triggers the pipeline.
2.  **Checkout Code:** The pipeline's first job is to check out the latest version of the code from the repository.
3.  **Install Dependencies:** The pipeline installs all necessary libraries and dependencies required for running static analysis, tests, and builds. This ensures a clean and consistent environment for every run.
4.  **Static Code Analysis:** Tools like linters, formatters, and security scanners analyze the source code without executing it. This step provides very fast feedback on code quality, style, and potential vulnerabilities before any time is spent on testing or compiling.
5.  **Unit Testing:** Fast-running automated tests are executed to verify individual components (functions, classes) in isolation. Running these before the build is a key part of the "fail fast" philosophy, as they can catch many logic errors quickly without needing to compile the whole application.
6.  **Build:** The source code is compiled into an executable or package. This step is essential for compiled languages (like Java, C#, Go) and will fail if there are any syntax or compilation errors. For interpreted languages, this step might be simpler, like packaging files together.
7.  **Integration & E2E Testing:** With the application built and running (often in a container), integration tests verify that different components work together correctly. End-to-end (E2E) tests can then simulate full user workflows. These tests are more complex and run after the basic code health has been confirmed.
8.  **Package & Create Artifact:** If all previous steps pass, the application is packaged into a final, deployable artifact (e.g., a Docker image, a JAR file) that is versioned and stored in an artifact repository.
9.  **Feedback:** The pipeline reports the final result (success or failure) back to the development team, often via notifications in chat tools or the version control system.

### Advantages of CI/CD Pipeline
- Provides quick feedback after each change
- Reduces the risk of integration issues by working in small batches
- Enables fault isolation by making it easier to identify which code change caused a failure
- Ensures that code is reviewed by multiple developers through pull requests
- Improves overall code quality and stability
- Reduces deployment risks by automating the testing process
- Speeds up development cycles by allowing developers to focus on building features instead of manually testing

## Deployment Pipeline
An automated manifestation of your process for getting software from version control into the hands of software users. Each change is verified through automated testing before deployment.

## Continuous Delivery (CD)
- Ensures that code is always in a deployable state and can be released to production at any time with minimal manual intervention.
- Code is deployed to a "production-like" environment before reaching production.
- Enables safe and rapid deployments.
- If production runs on Kubernetes, a development environment should also be set up in Kubernetes.

## Continuous Deployment
Continuous deployment (CD) is a software release process that uses automated testing to validate if changes to a codebase are correct and stable for immediate autonomous deployment to a production environment.

### Continuous Deployment vs. Continuous Delivery
- Continuous Deployment is one step beyond Continuous Delivery and means that deployment to the production environment is fully automated.
- In Continuous Delivery, the code is production-ready, but deployment can be done with a manual approval step. In Continuous Deployment, the code is always automatically deployed to production.

## Jenkins

### Jenkins Extensibility
Jenkins extensibility is implemented via Jenkins plugins.

### Jenkins Plugin Management
Jenkins plugins can be managed through the web interface or using the Jenkins CLI. Here are the common plugin management commands using jenkins-cli.jar:

```bash
# List all installed plugins
java -jar jenkins-cli.jar -s http://localhost:8080/ list-plugins

# Enable plugin(s)
java -jar jenkins-cli.jar -s http://localhost:8080/ enable-plugin PLUGIN_NAME [PLUGIN_NAME2 ...] [-restart]

# Disable plugin(s)
java -jar jenkins-cli.jar -s http://localhost:8080/ disable-plugin PLUGIN_NAME [PLUGIN_NAME2 ...] [-restart]

# Install plugin(s)
java -jar jenkins-cli.jar -s http://localhost:8080/ install-plugin PLUGIN_NAME [PLUGIN_NAME2 ...] [-restart]
```

**Notes:**
- Replace `http://localhost:8080/` with your Jenkins server URL if different
- The `-restart` flag is optional and will restart Jenkins after the operation
- You can specify multiple plugin names in a single command
- These commands require the jenkins-cli.jar file and Java to be installed

### Manual Plugin Removal
Jenkins CLI does not support direct plugin removal. To manually remove a plugin:

1. Navigate to the plugins directory on your Jenkins server:
```bash
$JENKINS_HOME/plugins/
```

2. Delete the following files for the plugin you want to remove:
   - The plugin's `.jpi` or `.hpi` file
   - The `.jpi.pinned` file (if it exists)

3. Restart Jenkins

**Note:** Make sure to backup your Jenkins configuration before manually removing plugins.

### Jenkins Backup
How to create a full backup in Jenkins?
- Copy Jenkins home directory and create database backup

### Jenkins Master-Slave Architecture
Jenkins supports distributed builds through a master-slave (controller-agent) architecture, which allows you to distribute workload across multiple machines.(Running builds on different OS/environments)
- **Master (Controller)**: Central server that manages build configuration, distributes builds to agents and handles UI
- **Slave (Agent)**: Worker machines that execute build jobs
- **Benefits**: Scalability, load balancing, environment isolation

### Jenkins Pipeline
Jenkins Pipeline is a set of plugins that supports implementing and integrating Continuous Delivery pipelines into Jenkins.

Key Points:
- Pipeline is defined in a `Jenkinsfile` (Pipeline as Code)
- Two syntax types: Declarative (newer, easier) and Scripted (traditional, Groovy-based)
- Blue Ocean provides visual pipeline editor and monitoring

## Build Automation Tools
Build automation tools automate the process of compiling source code, running tests, and packaging applications.

### Popular Build Tools
- **Maven**: Java-based, uses POM (Project Object Model)
  - Key features: Dependency management, standardized builds, multiple project support
  - Common phases: validate, compile, test, package, install, deploy

- **Gradle**: Modern build tool using Groovy DSL
  - Features: Flexible build configuration, multi-project builds
  - Uses build.gradle file for configuration
  - Task-based build system

### Benefits
- Reduces manual errors
- Ensures consistent builds
- Saves development time
- Integrates with CI/CD pipelines

## Types of Automated Tests
In a CI/CD pipeline, different types of automated tests are used to verify the application at various stages. The most common ones are:

*   **Unit Tests**:
    *   **Focus**: Tests the smallest individual parts of the code, like a single function or method, in isolation.
    *   **Goal**: To confirm that each component works correctly on its own. They are very fast and make up the majority of tests.

*   **Integration Tests**:
    *   **Focus**: Tests how different parts of the application work together. For example, how the application interacts with a database or an external API.
    *   **Goal**: To find issues in the interfaces and interactions between components.

*   **End-to-End (E2E) Tests**:
    *   **Focus**: Simulates a full user journey from start to finish. It tests the entire application, from the UI to the backend services.
    *   **Goal**: To validate that the entire system works as expected from a user's perspective. These tests are powerful but slower and more complex to maintain.

*   **Smoke Tests**:
    *   **Focus**: A small, quick set of tests run on a new build to ensure its most critical functions are working.
    *   **Goal**: To answer the basic question, "Is the build stable enough for further testing?" A failed smoke test means the build is immediately rejected.

*   **Regression Tests**:
    *   **Focus**: Reruns existing functional and non-functional tests.
    *   **Goal**: To ensure that recently added code or bug fixes have not accidentally broken existing functionality.

*   **Performance Tests**:
    *   **Focus**: Measures how the system performs in terms of responsiveness and stability under a particular workload.
    *   **Goal**: To evaluate speed, scalability, and stability. Examples include load testing and stress testing.

*   **Vulnerability (Security) Tests**:
    *   **Focus**: Scans the application for security flaws and vulnerabilities.
    *   **Goal**: To identify and fix security risks before they can be exploited. This can be done with Static (SAST) or Dynamic (DAST) analysis tools.

*   **UI (User Interface) Tests**:
    *   **Focus**: Specifically validates the graphical user interface (GUI) of the application.
    *   **Goal**: To check that UI elements like buttons, forms, and menus look correct and function as expected. E2E tests often include UI testing.

## Code Quality Analysis

Code quality analysis tools help evaluate code's maintainability and long-term usefulness by checking for potential bugs and security issues.


### Common Types of Static Analysis Tools
Static analysis tools examine code without running it, providing fast feedback on quality and potential issues. Key types include:

*   **Linters**:
    *   **Purpose**: Enforce coding style and find programming errors. They check for issues like unused variables, style inconsistencies, and potential bugs.
    *   **Examples**: ESLint (for JavaScript), Flake8 (for Python).

*   **Formatters**:
    *   **Purpose**: Automatically rewrite code to match a predefined style guide. This ensures consistency across the entire codebase.
    *   **Examples**: Prettier, Black (for Python).

*   **Security Scanners (SAST)**:
    *   **Purpose**: Scan code for known security vulnerabilities, like hardcoded secrets or insecure functions. Static Application Security Testing (SAST) is a key part of "shifting security left."
    *   **Examples**: Snyk, Checkmarx, and SonarQube's built-in security analysis.

### SonarQube
SonarQube is a code quality analysis tool that evaluates source code using static analysis, code coverage, and unit tests over time. It manages seven key aspects of code quality:

- **Architecture and design**: Evaluates code structure, module dependencies, and overall project organization
- **Code duplications**: Identifies repeated code blocks that violate DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
- **Unit test coverage**: Measures how much of the code is covered by automated tests
- **Potential bugs**: Detects code patterns that might cause issues in the future
- **Code complexity**: Analyzes code complexity metrics like cyclomatic complexity
- **Coding standards**: Ensures code follows defined style and best practices
- **Code documentation**: Checks if code is properly documented with comments and documentation

#### SonarQube Components
- **SonarLint**: IDE plugin for real-time code analysis
- **SonarScanner**: Command-line tool to analyze code
- **SonarQube Server**: Main server that processes analysis
- **SonarQube Database**: Stores analysis results and configuration

#### Quality Gates and Pipeline Integration
A **Quality Gate** is a core feature of SonarQube that acts as a set of pass/fail conditions for your code. It enforces quality standards on every new change.

*   **How it works**: After a SonarScanner analyzes the code, the results are sent to the SonarQube server. The server then checks these results against the rules defined in the Quality Gate.
*   **Example Conditions**: A Quality Gate can be configured to fail if:
    *   The test coverage on new code is less than 80%.
    *   There are any new "Blocker" or "Critical" issues.
    *   The code duplication on new code is more than 3%.
*   **Pipeline Control**: The CI pipeline can be configured to query the Quality Gate's status. If the status is "FAILED", the pipeline stops, preventing low-quality or insecure code from being merged or deployed. This is the primary mechanism for enforcing code quality automatically.

#### Secure Notifications with Webhooks
*   **Webhooks**: SonarQube uses webhooks to notify external systems (like your CI server) about the status of an analysis.
*   **Webhook Secrets**: To ensure these notifications are secure and genuinely from SonarQube, you should configure a "secret". This secret is used to create a hash signature for each payload. Your CI server can then verify this signature to confirm the request is authentic, preventing potential spoofing attacks.



## Artifact Management
Artifacts ensure that software outputs are reproducible, shareable, traceable, and secure. They are essential for CI/CD processes, versioning, test/deploy separation, and performance.

### What is an Artifact?
In the context of CI/CD, an artifact is the output of a build process. It's more than just a file; it's a versioned, packaged unit of your application that is ready for deployment or testing. The key is that it's an immutable, reusable output created from a specific commit.

Examples include:
- A `.jar` or `.war` file for a Java application
- A Docker image
- A `.zip` file containing compiled code and assets
- Test reports and code coverage data

### What is a Pipeline Artifact?
A pipeline artifact is a temporary file used within a CI/CD pipeline, typically for passing build outputs between pipeline stages.

### Why Use Artifacts?
1. **Reusability Without Rebuilding**
    - Build once and deploy to test/prod instead of rebuilding for each environment

2. **Traceability and Version Control**
   - Track which commit â†’ which artifact â†’ which environment (1.0.0, 1.0.1, 2.0.0-SNAPSHOT)
   - Answer questions like "What version is running in prod?"

3. **Security and License Control**
   - Allow only components with approved licenses

4. **CI/CD Automation and Consistency**
   - Use same artifact in Build â†’ Test â†’ Deploy steps


### Artifact Management Features
- **Creating Fully Traceable Builds**: Stores build metadata (build number, timestamp, branch, commit) with artifacts
- **Searching for Artifacts**: Enables finding artifacts by name, version, or tags
- **Manipulating Artifacts**: Supports moving, copying, and updating artifacts while maintaining metadata

### Artifact Types
- **Releases**: Stable, immutable versions (e.g., 1.0.0)
- **Snapshots**: Development versions that can change (e.g., 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT)

### Key Functions
- **Versioning**: Tracks metadata (build time, version number)
- **Retention**: Automatically deletes old and unnecessary artifacts based on defined rules
- **Permissions**: Controls access to repository
- **Promotion**: Moves artifacts between environments (dev â†’ test â†’ prod)
- **License Screening**: Ensures compliance with approved licenses
- **Performance**: Provides backup and load balancing

### Where to Store Artifacts? (Artifact Repositories)
Artifacts are stored in a centralized system called an Artifact Repository Manager. These tools are crucial for managing binaries and their metadata. Popular choices include:

- **JFrog Artifactory**: A universal repository manager supporting many package formats (Maven, npm, Docker, etc.). Often considered the industry standard.
- **Sonatype Nexus**: A popular open-source choice, especially strong for Java/Maven ecosystems.
- **GitHub Packages**: A good choice for projects hosted on GitHub, offering seamless integration with GitHub Actions.
- **GitLab Package Registry**: The native solution for teams using GitLab for their CI/CD and source control.
- **Docker Hub / Other Container Registries**: Specifically for storing and distributing Docker container images.
- **Cloud-Native Solutions (Azure Artifacts, AWS CodeArtifact, GCP Artifact Registry)**: Ideal for teams heavily invested in a specific cloud provider's ecosystem.

### Maven Artifact Structure
- **GroupId**: Organization identifier (e.g., org.apache.maven)
- **ArtifactId**: Component name (e.g., simple-webapp)
- **Version**: Release version (e.g., major.minor.patch)
- **Packaging**: File format (e.g., JAR, WAR, ZIP)

## Deployment Strategies

## Zero Downtime Deployment
Zero downtime deployment is a deployment strategy that ensures that the application is always available to users during the deployment process. It is achieved by deploying the new version of the application alongside the existing version, and then gradually switching the traffic to the new version.

### Blue/Green Deployment
You create two identical environments. Initially, Blue runs the current version handling all production traffic while Green is idle. After deploying and testing the new version on Green, the load balancer switches all production traffic to Green. Blue remains as a backup. Once Green is verified bug-free, Blue is retired and becomes the new idle environment for future deployments.

### Canary Deployment
You start by releasing a software update to a small group of users to test it and receive feedback. The update is rolled out to the rest of the users once the change is accepted.

### Rolling Deployment
A rolling deployment is a strategy that gradually replaces older versions of an application with newer versions by completely replacing the infrastructure on which it runs. Unlike blue-green, there is no environment isolation between versions, making it faster but riskier with more complex rollback.

### Shadow Deployment
A shadow deployment is a technique that involves releasing a new version of an application (version B) alongside the existing version (version A), but without impacting production traffic. Instead, incoming requests to version A are forked and sent to version B for testing and evaluation. This allows developers to monitor the performance and stability of the new version without affecting the user experience.

### A/B Deployment
A/B deployment strategy is a technique used to test and compare two different versions of a software or feature. It involves dividing users into two groups: Group A, which receives the existing version (control group), and Group B, which receives the new version (experimental group).

### Recreate Deployment
The recreate strategy is a simple deployment approach where version A is completely shut down before deploying version B. This results in downtime during the transition period, which depends on both shutdown and boot duration of the application.

### Key Differences: A/B vs Canary
* **Canary Deployment**: Focuses on safe rollout of a new version to detect issues early
* **A/B Deployment**: Aims to compare performance metrics between two different versions
## GitHub Actions: CI/CD Automation

GitHub Actions allows you to automate your software development workflows directly within your GitHub repository. It's commonly used for Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD).

### How GitHub Actions Works

1.  **Setup**: Create a `.github/workflows/` directory in the root of your repository.
2.  **Workflow Files**: Place one or more workflow definition files (YAML format, e.g., `main.yml`) inside this directory.
3.  **Trigger**: Workflows are triggered by specific **events** occurring in your repository (e.g., a push to a branch, a pull request creation, a new release).
4.  **Execution**: When triggered, the workflow runs one or more **jobs**.
5.  **Jobs**: Jobs consist of **steps** that execute on a specified **runner** (a virtual machine hosted by GitHub or self-hosted).

### Key Workflow Components

*   **`on` (Event)**: Defines the trigger for the workflow. Common events include `push`, `pull_request`, `release`. You can specify branches, types (e.g., `opened`, `published`), etc.
*   **`jobs`**: Contains one or more jobs to be executed. By default, jobs run in parallel.
    *   **Job Name** (e.g., `build`, `test`): A user-defined name for the job.
    *   **`runs-on`**: Specifies the type of runner machine to use (e.g., `ubuntu-latest`, `windows-latest`, `macos-latest`).
    *   **`needs`**: Defines dependencies between jobs. A job with `needs: other_job` will only start after `other_job` completes successfully, forcing serial execution.
    *   **`steps`**: A sequence of tasks to be executed within a job. Steps run on the same runner and can share data.
        *   **`name`**: An optional name for the step.
        *   **`uses`**: Specifies a reusable **action** to run (pre-built scripts/tasks from the marketplace or community, e.g., `actions/checkout@v3` to check out code).
        *   **`run`**: Executes shell commands directly on the runner.

### Example Workflow: Basic CI on Push

This example workflow triggers whenever code is pushed to the `main` branch. It runs a single job called `build` on an Ubuntu runner, checks out the code, and then simulates running build and test commands.

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci_pipeline.yml

name: CI workflow  # Name of the workflow that appears in GitHub Actions tab

on:  # Events that trigger the workflow
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]  # Triggered when code is pushed to main branch
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]  # Triggered when a PR is created against main branch

jobs:
  build:  # Job name
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest  # The type of runner that the job will run on
    container: python:3.9-slim  # Uses Docker container with Python 3.9 installed
    steps:  # List of steps to be executed
      - name: Checkout  # Get the code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3  # Official GitHub checkout action

      - name: Install Dependencies  # Prepare the project
        run: |  # Use pipe (|) to run multiple commands
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip  # Upgrade pip to latest version
          pip install -r requirements.txt  # Install dependencies from requirements.txt

      - name: Lint with flake8  # Check code quality
        run: |
          # Check for critical errors (syntax errors, undefined names)
          flake8 service --count --select=E9,F63,F7,F82 --show-source --statistics
          # General code quality check (complexity, line length)
          flake8 service --count --max-complexity=10 --max-line-length=127 --statistics

      - name: Run unit tests with nose  # Execute unit tests
        run: nosetests -v --with-spec --spec-color --with-coverage --cover-package=app
     

```

**To use this example:**
1. Create the `.github/workflows/` directory in your project.
2. Save the YAML content above as a file named `ci_pipeline.yml` (or any other `.yml` name) inside that directory.
3. Commit and push the changes to your `main` branch on GitHub.
4. Go to the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository to see the workflow run.
