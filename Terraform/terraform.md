# Terraform Notes

## Introduction
Terraform is an open-source tool used to automate and manage infrastructure, platform, and services. It follows a declarative language approach, meaning users specify the desired end state rather than defining each step to achieve it. Terraform determines how to execute the necessary actions to reach the specified state.

## Why Use Terraform?
Terraform enables infrastructure provisioning efficiently by automating setup and management tasks. It is particularly useful when creating and managing cloud-based infrastructure, such as AWS environments, Kubernetes clusters, and other cloud services.

## Terraform vs Ansible
- **Terraform** is primarily an infrastructure provisioning tool. It is best suited for creating and modifying infrastructure components such as servers, networks, and security groups.
- **Ansible** is a configuration management tool. It is mainly used for configuring, deploying applications, and updating software on existing infrastructure.
- **Common Practice**: Many DevOps teams use both tools togetherâ€”Terraform for provisioning and Ansible for configuration management.

## Terraform Workflow
1. **Provisioning Infrastructure**: Creating networks, security rules, servers, etc.
2. **Managing Infrastructure**: Adding/removing resources and modifying configurations.
3. **Replicating Environments**: Duplicating infrastructure setups for development, staging, and production environments.

## Terraform Architecture
### Core Components
1. **Terraform Core**
   - Reads configuration files.
   - Maintains the infrastructure state.
   - Plans and applies infrastructure changes.

2. **Providers**
   - Connect Terraform to various cloud and service providers (AWS, Azure, Kubernetes, etc.).
   - Expose resources that Terraform can manage.

## Declarative vs Imperative Approach
- **Declarative (Terraform)**: Specifies the desired end state. Terraform determines the steps to achieve it.
- **Imperative**: Specifies step-by-step instructions to reach the end state.
- **Advantage of Declarative Approach**: Easier to maintain, update, and understand infrastructure configurations.

## Key Terraform Commands
- `terraform refresh`: Updates the state file with the current infrastructure state.
- `terraform plan`: Shows the changes Terraform will apply to reach the desired state.
- `terraform apply`: Executes the planned changes and provisions the infrastructure.
- `terraform destroy`: Removes all provisioned infrastructure.

## Conclusion
Terraform is a powerful tool for managing infrastructure as code. By leveraging its declarative approach, it simplifies infrastructure provisioning, maintenance, and replication across different environments.
