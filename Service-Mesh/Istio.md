## Introduction

This note covers why service meshes were created and the fundamental architecture of Istio.

## The Problem: The Chaos of Microservices

The shift from monoliths to microservices solved many problems but created a new set of complex networking challenges that every development team had to solve repeatedly:

### Core Challenges

- **Service Discovery**: How does service A find service B in a dynamic environment?
- **Resilience**: How do you handle retries, timeouts, and circuit breaking to prevent cascading failures?
- **Security**: How do you enforce encryption (mTLS) and authorization between services?
- **Observability**: How do you get consistent metrics, logs, and traces for all service-to-service communication?
- **Traffic Management**: How do you implement advanced routing like canary deployments or A/B testing?

## The "Old" Solution: In-App Libraries

Early solutions, like Netflix OSS (Hystrix, Ribbon) and Spring Cloud, addressed these problems by providing libraries that developers added to their applications.

### Limitations

- **Language/Framework Lock-in**: You were often tied to a specific ecosystem (e.g., Java/Spring)
- **Bloated Applications**: Each microservice had to include and maintain a large set of infrastructure-related dependencies
- **Mixed Logic**: Business logic and infrastructure logic were mixed together in the same application code

## The Service Mesh Solution

The core idea of a service mesh is to move all this complex networking logic out of the application code and into a separate, dedicated proxy that runs alongside every service.

## Istio Architecture

Istio is the leading implementation of a service mesh. Its architecture is split into two main parts:

### Data Plane (The "Doers" ðŸ’ª)

- This is a fleet of **Envoy Proxies**
- They run as **sidecars** (a separate container in the same Pod) next to each of your application containers
- Their job is to transparently intercept all inbound and outbound network traffic from your application
- They handle the retries, timeouts, mTLS, metrics collection, etc.

### Control Plane (The "Brain" ðŸ§ )

- This is a central component called **Istiod**
- Its job is to configure and manage all the Envoy proxies in the data plane
- You provide high-level rules to Istiod (e.g., "all traffic between services must be encrypted"), and it translates them into low-level configuration for each Envoy proxy

## How It Works: Key Mechanisms

### 1. Sidecar Injection
Envoy proxies are automatically added to your application pods when they are created. This is typically enabled by adding a label to your Kubernetes namespace (e.g., `istio-injection: enabled`).

### 2. Traffic Interception
An init container in the pod sets up iptables rules to ensure all of the application's network traffic is automatically routed through its Envoy sidecar proxy.

### 3. Identity (SPIFFE)
Istio gives each workload a strong, cryptographic identity. This is the foundation for its security features, like automatic mutual TLS (mTLS), which encrypts all traffic within the mesh by default.

## Handling Edge Traffic

Istio also uses Envoy to manage traffic entering and leaving the mesh:

### Ingress Gateway
A dedicated Envoy proxy that manages traffic coming into the mesh from the outside world.

### Egress Gateway
A dedicated Envoy proxy that manages traffic going out of the mesh to external services.

## Quick Reference

| Component | Purpose | Location |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| Envoy Proxy | Data plane proxy | Sidecar container |
| Istiod | Control plane | Kubernetes cluster |
| Ingress Gateway | External traffic in | Edge of cluster |
| Egress Gateway | External traffic out | Edge of cluster |
