## What is Agile?

Agile is an iterative approach to project management that focuses on delivering value to customers quickly and adapting to changes. Unlike traditional methods where long-term planning is done upfront, Agile emphasizes planning small increments, receiving customer feedback, and adjusting as needed.

## Characteristics of Agile

Agile emphasizes several key characteristics:

-   **Adaptive Planning:** Planning occurs in small iterations rather than for the entire project duration upfront.
-   **Evolutionary Development:** The product is built incrementally and evolves based on feedback.
-   **Early Delivery:** Delivering functional software to the customer early and frequently is crucial for gathering feedback.
-   **Continuous Improvement:** Feedback loops enable continuous improvement of both the product and the team's process.
-   **Responsiveness to Change:** Agile embraces changing requirements and allows teams to adapt quickly without being rigidly bound to initial plans.

## Traditional Waterfall Development

Waterfall is a **sequential, phase-based approach** to software development.

-   **Phases:** Requirements -> Design -> Coding -> Integration -> Testing -> Deployment.
-   Each phase must be completed before the next begins (strict entrance/exit criteria).
-   Difficult and costly to go back to earlier phases ("swimming upstream").

### Problems with Waterfall

-   **No provision for change:** Rigid structure makes adapting to changing requirements difficult.
-   **Late feedback:** You don't know if the software truly works until the very end.
-   **Siloed work:** Teams work in isolation, potentially leading to integration issues and lost information.
-   **Costly late-stage mistakes:** Errors found later (e.g., in testing) are expensive to fix.
-   **Long lead times:** Delays delivery of value to the customer.

## Extreme Programming (XP)

Introduced by Kent Beck, XP is an **iterative and incremental** approach, considered one of the first Agile methods. It focuses on improving software quality and responsiveness.

-   Emphasizes **tight feedback loops** (releases, iterations, daily stand-ups, pair programming).

### XP Values

-   **Simplicity:** Do what's needed and no more; avoid over-engineering.
-   **Communication:** Foster high levels of interaction within the team.
-   **Feedback:** Use frequent feedback loops to guide development.
-   **Respect:** Value all team members' contributions equally.
-   **Courage:** Be honest about estimates and commitments.

## Kanban

Originating from Japanese manufacturing (meaning "billboard" or "sign"), Kanban focuses on **continuous flow** and visualizing work.

### Kanban Core Principles

-   **Visualize the workflow:** Make work visible to manage it effectively (e.g., Kanban boards).
-   **Limit Work In Progress (WIP):** Avoid bottlenecks and multitasking by limiting simultaneous tasks.
-   **Manage and enhance flow:** Continuously seek ways to improve the workflow speed and efficiency.
-   **Make policies explicit:** Ensure everyone understands processes and definitions (e.g., Definition of Done).
-   **Continuously improve:** Use feedback loops to refine the process.
