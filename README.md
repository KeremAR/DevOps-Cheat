## Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

### **What is IaC?**
- With IaC, we use code to manage and provision infrastructure instead of doing it manually.
-It allows infrastructure to be deployed and maintained in a consistent, repeatable way.
-IaC files are typically stored in Git repositories, making it easy to track changes, collaborate, and roll back to previous configurations.

### **Benefits**
-If your entire infrastructure fails and you lose all servers or your Kubernetes cluster crashes, you can quickly recreate the exact same environment using IaC scripts.
-All the logic and configuration are embedded in scripts, allowing for faster recovery and minimal human error.
